## 📖 Included Resources

### 🧬 Essay: Bioinformatics in Modern Biology  
A structured explanation of bioinformatics applications, significance, and impact across healthcare, agriculture, and research — useful for students and portfolio demonstration.

### 🧮 GC Content Calculator (`simple_code.py`)
A clean, beginner‑friendly Python script that:

- Accepts DNA sequences (FASTA supported)
- Validates and formats input
- Calculates GC content accurately

Great hands‑on example for newcomers to bioinformatics scripting.

### 📄 scRNA‑seq Cancer Evolution Article  
A conceptual summary of how **single‑cell RNA sequencing (scRNA‑seq)** helps understand:

- Tumor evolution & heterogeneity  
- Cancer stem cell dynamics  
- Therapeutic resistance mechanisms
